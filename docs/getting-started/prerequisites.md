# Prerequisites

This guide helps you prepare everything needed to deploy a KubeAid-managed Kubernetes cluster. Whether you're setting up a production environment in the cloud or a local development cluster, start here.

---

## Choose Your Deployment

KubeAid supports two deployment paths. Choose based on your use case:

| Deployment Type | Best For | What You Need |
|-----------------|----------|---------------|
| **Cloud / Distributed** | Production workloads, multi-node clusters | Cloud provider account (AWS, Azure, Hetzner) or bare metal servers |
| **Local (K3D)** | Development, testing, learning KubeAid | Docker running on your local machine |

> **New to KubeAid?** Start with a **Local K3D** deployment to explore the platform without incurring any cloud costs.

## System Requirements

### Minimum Compute Requirements

| Component | Local (K3D) | Cloud / Bare Metal (per node) |
|-----------|-------------|-------------------------------|
| **RAM** | 8GB (16GB recommended) | 16GB+ |
| **CPU** | 4 cores | 4+ cores |
| **Storage** | 50GB free disk space | 100GB+ |

---

## Supported Architectures

KubeAid runs on the following CPU architectures:

| Architecture | Also Known As | Examples |
|--------------|---------------|----------|
| **amd64** | x86_64 | Intel Core, AMD Ryzen, most cloud VMs |
| **arm64** | aarch64 | Apple Silicon (M1/M2/M3/M4), Raspberry Pi 4+ |

---

## Supported Operating Systems

### For Your Local Machine (running KubeAid CLI)

- **Linux** - Ubuntu, Debian, Fedora, RHEL, etc.
- **macOS** - Intel and Apple Silicon
- **Windows** - Via WSL2 (Windows Subsystem for Linux)

### For Cluster Nodes

- **Linux only** - Ubuntu 22.04+ recommended

---

## Common Dependencies  
  
Before setting up any KubeAid cluster, ensure you have the following tools and resources ready:  

### Required Software  
  
The following packages must be installed on your local machine:  
  
- [`kubectl`](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/) - Kubernetes command-line tool  
- [`jq`](https://jqlang.org/download/) - JSON processor  
- [`terragrunt`](https://terragrunt.gruntwork.io/docs/getting-started/install/) - Terraform wrapper  
- [`terraform`](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/install) - Infrastructure as Code tool  
- [`bcrypt`](https://github.com/bitnami/bcrypt-cli) - Password hashing utility  
- [`wireguard`](https://www.wireguard.com/install/) - VPN software (optional, for private cluster access)  
- [`yq`](https://github.com/mikefarah/yq) - YAML processor
  
### Docker  
  
Ensure [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) is installed and running locally on your machine. Docker Desktop is recommended for Linux, macOS, and Windows users for ease of use.
  
### Git Repositories  
  
You need to set up two Git repositories:  
  
1. **KubeAid Repository**: Fork or mirror the [KubeAid repository](https://github.com/Obmondo/KubeAid) from Obmondo.   
     
   **Important**: Never make changes on the master/main branch of your mirror of the KubeAid repository, as this branch is used to deliver updates. All customizations should happen in your `kubeaid-config` repository.
  
2. **KubeAid Config Repository**: Fork the [KubeAid Config repository](https://github.com/Obmondo/kubeaid-config), which will contain your cluster-specific configurations.
  
### Git Provider Credentials  
  
Keep your Git provider credentials ready. These will be used by ArgoCD for GitOps operations.  
  
#### GitHub  
  
Create a [Personal Access Token (PAT)](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/managing-your-personal-access-tokens#creating-a-fine-grained-personal-access-token) with permission to write to your KubeAid Config fork. This PAT will be used as the password.
  
**Best Practice**: Create a separate user called `obmondo-<service>-user` and use its Personal Access Token instead of your personal account token.
  
#### GitLab  
  
For GitLab, you can create a Project Access Token (available in self-hosted and enterprise GitLab) or create a separate user called `obmondo-<service>-user` and provide its Personal Access Token.
  
## Provider-Specific Prerequisites  
  
### AWS  
  
- **AWS SSH KeyPair**: Create an AWS SSH KeyPair in the region where you'll be bootstrapping the cluster.
  
### Azure  
  
- **System Requirements**: A Linux or MacOS computer with at least 16GB of RAM (8GB might work but may encounter Out of memory (OOM) issues).
  
- **Service Principal**: [Register an application (Service Principal) in Microsoft Entra ID](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity-platform/quickstart-register-app).  
  
- **SSH Keypairs**:   
  - An OpenSSH type SSH keypair (private key for SSH access to VMs). You can generate this using:
    ```bash
    ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -f azure-ssh-key
    ```
  - An RSA key pair in PEM format (required for Azure Workload Identity setup). You can generate this using:
    ```bash
    openssl genrsa -out jwt-signing-key.pem 2048
    openssl rsa -in jwt-signing-key.pem -pubout -out jwt-signing-pub.pem
    ```
  
### Bare Metal  
  
For general bare metal setups (non-Hetzner), only the common dependencies are required. The bare metal provider uses [Kubermatic KubeOne](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubeone) under the hood for SSH-only access platforms without API host management support.   
  
### Hetzner  
  
#### Hetzner HCloud  
  
- **HCloud SSH KeyPair**: Create an HCloud SSH KeyPair. Note that no two HCloud SSH KeyPairs can have the same SSH public key. 
  
#### Hetzner Bare Metal  
  
- **Hetzner Bare Metal SSH KeyPair**: Create a Hetzner Bare Metal SSH KeyPair at https://robot.hetzner.com/key/index. Note that no two Hetzner Bare Metal SSH KeyPairs can have the same SSH public key.   
  
- **RAID Cleanup** (if applicable): If you plan to set `cloud.hetzner.bareMetal.wipeDisks: True` in your configuration, remove any pre-existing RAID setup from your Hetzner Bare Metal servers by executing `wipefs -fa <partition-name>` for each partition.   
  
#### Hetzner Hybrid  
  
Requires both HCloud and Hetzner Bare Metal prerequisites listed above.   
  
### Local K3D  
  
For local testing with K3D, only the common dependencies are required. Note that this setup does not support cluster upgrades and disaster recovery.
  
## Notes  
  
- The cluster setup follows GitOps principles using ArgoCD, ensuring all changes are version-controlled through Git.
- KubeAid clusters are designed to be private by default, with optional Wireguard gateway for secure access.
- All providers use Cilium CNI running in kube-proxyless mode for networking.
