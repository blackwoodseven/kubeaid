# Why KubeAid?

An operations team typically has 2 hugely important tasks:

1. Developing a setup that enables as high availability for each company's applications as possible.
   This is a very difficult task that constantly evolves as the software used in the setup evolves.

2. Increasing the velocity of the application teams by assisting them with improving how their application operates in production.

Even with Kubernetes there is a lot of work to be done to pick the right solutions for each feature you need - and it is our experience that 95% of what one team needs is the EXACT same most of the other teams need.

### The Problem KubeAid Solves

**KubeAid** aims to be a constantly evolving solution for bullet 1. above, i.e. enabling the collaboration of operations teams across the
world, to increase the velocity of every operations team, so they can focus on bullet 2. — All the while everyone gets to enjoy a
highly available and secure operations setup.

Quite often it is very difficult to find enough people who can do this work — especially since EVERY other company is
building a replica of what you are building to solve bullet 1. This is exactly WHY Kubernetes was started, to help enable
collaboration between teams across companies on a shared goal.

**KubeAid** is being developed by [Obmondo](https://obmondo.com). With this project we build the solutions our customers need — and
share the work with everyone. We feel this is the only way we ever have a chance of actually
delivering the features that every operations team should have without needing to have a subject matter expert at hand
for everything.

The fact that we help many customers operate their Kubernetes clusters also enables us to hire more Kubernetes experts than is
normally available — and we can offer them a job where they get time to work on the challenges that interest them, to a
much higher degree because we focus on one thing, furthering this project and delivering value to the customers that
sponsor it, via their subscriptions and development tasks they ask of us.

[Obmondo](https://obmondo.com) offers low cost subscriptions, where we monitor your clusters and handle your alerts
around the clock 24/7 — enabling teams to not have to worry about who is absent, on holiday or ill — We are there to back them up if
they need it.
