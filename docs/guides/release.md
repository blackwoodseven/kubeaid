# KubeAid Release Process

This guide outlines the steps to update managed charts and publish a new release of KubeAid.

## 1. Update Managed Helm Charts

The first step is to synchronize all managed Helm charts with their upstream sources. This script will update the charts and automatically switch you to a new branch for your Pull Request.

### Option A: Standard (Linux/Native)
If you have `yq` (Go version), `helm`, and `git` installed locally:

```bash
./bin/manage-helm-chart.sh --update-all

Branch 'Helm_Update_20260119_MjA5NDkK' set up to track remote branch 'master' from 'origin'.
Switched to a new branch 'Helm_Update_20260119_MjA5NDkK'
Current KubeAid version: 23.0.0
Helm chart argo-cd is cached and on latest version 9.2.4...
```
### Option B: Docker Environment (macOS)
For macOS users or to ensure a clean environment, use the provided Docker workflow.
1. Start the Builder Container Run this from the root of the repo to mount your current directory into an Ubuntu container:
   ```bash
   docker run --rm -it -v $(pwd):/build -w /build ubuntu:24.04 bash
   ```
2. Configure Environment Inside the running container, execute the following block to install dependencies and trigger the update:
   ```bash
   apt-get update && apt-get install -y git curl
   curl -L https://github.com/mikefarah/yq/releases/latest/download/yq_linux_amd64 -o /usr/bin/yq && chmod +x /usr/bin/yq
   curl -fsSL -o get_helm.sh https://raw.githubusercontent.com/helm/helm/main/scripts/get-helm-4
   chmod 700 get_helm.sh && ./get_helm.sh
   ./bin/manage-helm-chart.sh --update-all
   ```

## 2. Publish a New Release of KubeAid
once the Pull Request from Step 1 is merged into `master`, generate the release notes and tag the release.
    
    ```sh
    ./bin/release.sh
