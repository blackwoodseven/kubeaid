# trivy-operator

Helm chart wrapper for [Trivy Operator](https://aquasecurity.github.io/trivy-operator/) — continuous in-cluster image and Kubernetes resource vulnerability scanning, with Prometheus metrics and pre-baked alert rules.

## How it works

Trivy Operator watches workloads (Deployment, StatefulSet, DaemonSet, Job, CronJob, Pod) across the cluster and emits per-resource scan results as CRDs:

- `VulnerabilityReport` — image-level CVEs
- `ConfigAuditReport` — workload misconfigurations
- `ExposedSecretReport` — leaked credentials in image layers
- `RbacAssessmentReport` — RBAC anti-patterns

A built-in Trivy server is shared across scanners (no per-scan job pulls), and the operator exposes Prometheus metrics so the existing kube-prometheus-stack picks up CVE counts as time series.

## Why this complements Harbor

Harbor scans images **at push time** to a Harbor registry. Trivy Operator scans **what's actually running in the cluster**, regardless of source registry — covering external-pull images (`docker.io`, `quay.io`, `ghcr.io`, etc.) and reflecting CVEs added to the database after the image was pushed.

## Quick start

```yaml
# values.yaml
trivy-operator:
  excludeNamespaces: "kube-system,trivy-system,argocd"
  serviceMonitor:
    enabled: true
  trivy:
    ignoreUnfixed: true
    severity: "CRITICAL,HIGH"

kubeaid:
  prometheusRule:
    enabled: true
```

> **Note:** `ImageOutdatedAndVulnerable` requires `version_checker_is_latest_version` metric. Deploy the [`version-checker`](../version-checker) chart alongside this one.

## Configuration

### Upstream chart (`trivy-operator.*`)

Forwarded to the [aquasecurity/trivy-operator](https://artifacthub.io/packages/helm/trivy-operator/trivy-operator) Helm chart. See upstream values.yaml for the full surface; the most relevant knobs are mirrored in this chart's `values.yaml` with KubeAid-friendly defaults.

| Parameter | Description | Default |
|-----------|-------------|---------|
| `trivy-operator.excludeNamespaces` | Namespaces to skip scanning | `"kube-system,trivy-system,argocd"` |
| `trivy-operator.serviceMonitor.enabled` | Create ServiceMonitor for Prometheus scraping | `true` |
| `trivy-operator.operator.metricsVulnIdEnabled` | Emit per-CVE-ID metric labels | `true` |
| `trivy-operator.trivy.ignoreUnfixed` | Drop CVEs with no fix available | `true` |
| `trivy-operator.trivy.severity` | Severities to report | `"CRITICAL,HIGH"` |
| `trivy-operator.trivy.builtInTrivyServer` | Use single in-cluster Trivy server | `true` |

### KubeAid additions (`kubeaid.*`)

| Parameter | Description | Default |
|-----------|-------------|---------|
| `kubeaid.prometheusRule.enabled` | Generate PrometheusRule (2 recording rules + `ImageOutdatedAndVulnerable` + 3 health alerts) | `true` |
| `kubeaid.prometheusRule.additionalLabels` | Extra labels added to the PrometheusRule object (for Prometheus selector matching) | `{}` |
| `kubeaid.prometheusRule.additionalAnnotations` | Extra annotations added to the PrometheusRule object | `{}` |

## Alerts shipped

- `ImageOutdatedAndVulnerable` — fires when a running image has `Critical`/`High` CVEs **and** a newer tag is available in the source registry. Joins the two recording rules on `(image, current_version)`. **Requires the [`version-checker`](../version-checker) chart deployed in the cluster.** Persists for 6h before firing to absorb registry/scanner flaps.

### Why two recording rules

Trivy describes an image as three labels (`image_registry`, `image_repository`, `image_tag`); version-checker
emits a single `image` label copied straight from the pod spec, with **no registry normalisation** — its
`urlTagSHAFromImage` only splits off the tag and digest. So `nginx:1.25` is `nginx` to version-checker and
`index.docker.io/library/nginx` to Trivy, and a naive join on `image` silently matches nothing for every
short-form Docker Hub reference while still working for fully-qualified ones.

`record::version_checker::outdated` applies Docker's reference expansion rules so both sides speak the same
canonical `registry/repository` form before the join.

### Health alerts

These exist because the dangerous failure is not a noisy alert, it is a silent one. Each watches a way
`ImageOutdatedAndVulnerable` can stop firing while everything still looks fine:

- `TrivyVersionCheckerJoinEmpty` — both inputs have series but the join yields nothing, meaning the
  normalisation no longer matches how images are referenced in this cluster.
- `VersionCheckerMetricsMissing` — version-checker stopped reporting. It is load-bearing for the CVE alert and
  ships no alerts of its own, so without this it can fail open unnoticed.
- `TrivyOperatorMetricsMissing` — no vulnerability metrics at all: operator down, ServiceMonitor not scraped, or
  every report expired past `scannerReportTTL` without refresh.

> Note: a previous `TrivyOperatorScannerStuck` alert queried `trivy_resource_last_scan_timestamp_seconds`. That
> metric does not exist — trivy-operator exposes no last-scan timestamp of any kind — so the alert could never
> fire. Scanner liveness is now inferred from whether reports exist at all.

## Useful commands

```bash
# All vulnerable workloads
kubectl get vulnerabilityreports -A

# Critical-only summary
kubectl get vulnerabilityreports -A -o json | jq '.items[] | {ns:.metadata.namespace, res:.report.artifact.repository, crit:.report.summary.criticalCount}'

# Force a re-scan of a workload
kubectl annotate deploy/my-app -n my-ns trivy-operator.aquasecurity.github.io/last-scan-checksum-

# Inspect operator logs
kubectl logs -n trivy-system deploy/trivy-operator -f
```

## Notes

- This chart is a wrapper. Bump `trivy-operator` chart version in `Chart.yaml` to pull upstream fixes.
- For air-gapped clusters, mirror the `aquasec/trivy-db` and `aquasec/trivy-java-db` images and override `trivy-operator.trivy.image.repository` and `trivy.dbRepository`.
- Pairs with `vuls-dictionary` (host-level scanning) — host CVEs go to Vuls, container CVEs go to Trivy Operator.
