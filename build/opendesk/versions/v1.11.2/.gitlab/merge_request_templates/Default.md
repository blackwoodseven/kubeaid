Thank you for your contribution!

Please follow these simple guidelines to continue:

- Select a MR template in case you contribution is covers more than simple documentation/non functional changes:
  - `Update`: Major/minor updates of openDesk core applications, the ones listed on the [README.md](../../README.md). Main commit should be `feat(component): ...`
  - `Bugfix`: For (bug)fixes in the platform or non-update/feature releases of the openDesk core applications. Main commit should be `fix(component): ...`
  - `Feature`: An update in the platform providing support for a specific feature. Main commit should be `feat(component): ...`
  - `Other`: All other changes.
  - In case you just do a `chore`/`docs` commit, you can skip the templates from above.
- Create MRs early and use the "draft" state to show that this MR isn't ready for review and merge.
- Always assign the MR to yourself and set somebody from the development team as reviewer. If you do not know whom to chose leave the reviewer empty.
- Flag the MR "ready" as soon as it can be reviewed and QA'd.
